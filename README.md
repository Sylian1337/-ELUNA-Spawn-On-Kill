[SCRIPT]
This script will spawn a creature configured into the "config.lua" file.

[FEATURES]
Spawn creatures by chance on kill or set "alwaysSpawn" on to spawn a creature every kill. You are also able to change the chance for when to spawn a creature. Everything is in the "Config.lua" file, with lots of documentation.

[SETUP]
1. Throw the folder into your "lua_scripts" folder.

2. Open the configuration file "Config.lua" and examine the settings.

3. Enter the ID of the creature you want to spawn, and remember to look around in the "Config.lua" to set the different settings to your needs. All the values are documented inside the "Config.lua".

4. That is all; the script is now ready.

5. Have fun!
